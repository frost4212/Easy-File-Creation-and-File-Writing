# FileCreating - Java File Handling  

This is a simple Java program that allows users to create and write to a text file.  

## Features  
✅ Prompts the user to enter a filename and creates a `.txt` file with that name.  
✅ Checks if the file already exists to prevent duplicates.  
✅ Allows the user to enter text, which is then written to the created file.  
✅ Handles potential errors using `try-catch` blocks to ensure robustness.  

## How to Use  
1. Run the program.  
2. Enter the desired filename (without the `.txt` extension).  
3. If the file doesn’t exist, it will be created. If it already exists, the program notifies you.  
4. Enter the text you want to write into the file.  
5. The text is saved, and the file is closed.  

## Requirements  
- Java 8 or later  
- A terminal or IDE to run the program
